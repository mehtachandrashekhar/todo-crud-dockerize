# Todo CRUD Application - Dockerized

This project is a fork of [CRUD Application by singhpriteshh](https://github.com/singhpriteshh/CRUD), which has been extended to include Docker support for easy deployment and containerization.

## Features

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for managing tasks.
- Lightweight and efficient application, now containerized using Docker.
- Easy to set up and deploy with Docker Compose.

---

### Prerequisites

Before running this application, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the application:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mehtachandrashekhar/todo-crud-dockerize.git
cd todo-crud-dockerize
```

### 2. Build the Docker Image

Build the application image using the following command:

```bash
docker build -t todo-crud-app .
```

### 3. Run the Application

Use `docker-compose` to start the application:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will:

- Start the application container.
- Map the necessary ports.

### 4. Access the Application

Once the containers are up, the application will be available at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

(Replace `3000` with the port configured in your `docker-compose.yml` file if different.)
